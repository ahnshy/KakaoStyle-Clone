<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## 📢 [Overview]
- Kakao style clone coding
- Cloning target website : https://kakaostyle.com/
<br/>

## 🚩 [Objective]
- Appropriate site for senior developer training. (I trained this site as a real best practice in the company.)
- Implemented with the vue3.js and Composition API, SPA architecture, allowing senior vue.js JavaScript developers to implement this project.
- Cloned a simple SPA from a website called "Kakao style" in Korea.
<br/>

## 🛠️ [Technologies]
- **Vue 3**: A framework that enables dynamic CSR by utilizing the Vue3 Composition API and is optimized for SPA implementation.
- **Vite**: A very fast JavaScript build tool that is more advanced than npm.
- **Vue-router**: Technology involved in routing links and page services in vuejs.
- **bootstrap**: CSS and JS framework that helps make websites easy.

* It is easy to expand to other javaScript library (fetch or axios, tailwindcss etc).
* It is easy to expand to other storeage system such as notion or firebase. (The three layers at the bottom are optimized for applying the for loop. ^^)
